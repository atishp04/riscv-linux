The cpu-map DT entry in ARM can describe the CPU topology in much better
way compared to other existing approaches. RISC-V can easily adopt this
binding to represent its own CPU topology. Thus, both cpu-map DT
binding and topology parsing code can be moved to a common location so
that RISC-V or any other architecture can leverage that.

The relevant discussion regarding unifying cpu topology can be found in
[1].

arch_topology seems to be a perfect place to move the common code. I
have not introduced any significant functional changes in the moved code.
The only downside in this approach is that the capacity code will be
executed for RISC-V as well. But, it will exit immediately after not
able to find the appropriate DT node. If the overhead is considered too
much, we can always compile out capacity related functions under a
different config for the architectures that do not support them.

There was an opportunity to unify topology data structure for ARM32 done
by patch 3/4. But, I refrained from making any other changes as I am not
very well versed with original intention for some functions that
are present in arch_topology.c. I hope this patch series can be served
as a baseline for such changes in the future.

The patches have been tested for RISC-V and compile tested for ARM64,
ARM32 & x86.

The socket change[2] is also now part of this series.

It can be verified with OpenSBI with following additional compile time
option.

FW_PAYLOAD_FDT="unleashed_topology.dtb"

Changes from v3->v4
1. Get rid of ARM32 specific information in topology strucuture.
2. Remove redundant functions from ARM32 and use common code instead. 

Changes from v2->v3
1. Cover letter update with experiment DT for topology changes.
2. Added the patch for [2].

Changes from v1->v2
