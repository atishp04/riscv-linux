* RISC-V local timer

RISC-V supervisor manual specifies that timer interrupt is connected to
individual harts directly to minimize the interrupt latency. These per
hart timer is connected via Hart Level Interrupt Controller (HLIC). The
HLIC will also act as the interrupt parent for timer interrupt.

Required properties:

- compatible : "riscv,local-timer"
- interrupts : Should be Timer interrupt number. Current supervisor manual
	       defines it be 5.
- interrupt-parent : Should point to local interrupt-controller phandle.

Example:
	cpus {
    		#address-cells = <0x00000001>;
    		..
		..
		cpu@0 {
      		..
		..
		timer {
        		interrupts = <0x00000005>;
        		interrupt-parent = <0x00000004>;
        		compatible = "riscv,local-timer";
      		}
      		interrupt-controller {
			..
			..
			compatible = "riscv,cpu-intc";
			linux,phandle = <0x00000004>;
			phandle = <0x00000004>;
			}
		}
